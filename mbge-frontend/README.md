# Most Boring Game Ever Frontend

Frontend for the most boring game ever.

Out of Scope
 * e2e tests
 * Pagination for the high score list
 * Make backend urls configurable
 * Handling of backend errors in the frontend
 * Showing a spinner if backend request time is too long

### Local Development
 * Start the mbge-backend
 * yarn start (perhaps also yarn install)
